<h1>Call for Proposals</h1>



<p><strike><a href="/person/new">Register</a> and <a href="/proposal/new" title="New Proposal">submit a proposal</a>, or read on for more information.</strike> The call for proposals is now closed! Thanks to everyone who submitted.</p>
<hr />
<p>
PyCon Australia 2016 is pleased to announce that its Call for Proposals is now open! The conference this year will be held from Friday 12th August to Tuesday 16th August. Miniconfs and special events are held on Friday 12th. The main conference is held on Saturday 13th and Sunday 14th. Monday 15th and Tuesday 16th are developer sprints.
</p><p>
<b>Important Dates</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Call for Proposals opens: Thursday, 7th April</li>
<li>Proposal submission deadline: Sunday, 8th May</li>
<li>Proposal acceptance: Sunday, 29th May</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
PyCon Australia attracts professional developers from all walks of life, including industry, government, and science, as well as enthusiast and student developers. Weâ€™re looking for proposals for presentations and tutorials on any aspect of Python programming, at all skill levels from novice to advanced.
</p><p>
Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or commercial projects; or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the program.
We're especially interested in short presentations that will teach conference-goers something new and useful. Can you show attendees how to use a module? Explore a Python language feature? Package an application?</p>

<h2>Special Events</h2>
<p>Four special events will be held on Friday 12th August, as a prelude to the main conference. These special events are:
<ul>
<li><a href="/programme/djangocon_au">DjangoConAU</a></li>
<li><a href="/programme/python_in_education_seminar">Python in Education</a></li>
<li><a href="/programme/science_and_data_miniconf">Science and Data</a></li>
<li><a href="/programme/internet_of_things_miniconf">Internet of Things</a></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
If your talk is targeted to a particular field, or requires a lot of prior knowledge, the special events might be a better fit than the main part of the conference. 
</p><p>
We are running a combined call for proposals for all the special events and the main conference. In the submission form you can nominate which event(s) your proposal is targeting.
</p>

<p>
<b>DjangoCon AU</b> is the annual conference of Django users in the Southern Hemisphere. It covers all aspects of web software development, from design to deployment - and, of course, the use of the Django framework itself. It provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the state of the art of web software development with other developers and designers.
</p><p>
<b>The Python in Education Seminar</b> aims to bring together community workshop organisers, professional Python instructors and professional educators across primary, secondary and tertiary levels to share their experiences and requirements, and identify areas of potential collaboration with each other and also with the broader Python community.
</p><p>
<b>The Science and Data Miniconf</b> is a forum for people using Python to tackle problems in science and data analysis. It aims to cover commercial and research interests in applications of science, engineering, mathematics, finance, and data analysis using Python, including AI and 'big data' topics.
</p><p>
<b>The Internet of Things (IoT) Miniconf</b> will be a day devoted to presentations and demonstrations of how Python powers IoT devices, applications and services. The proliferation of distributed devices connected to the Internet has been an enabler for a variety of new capabilities and services ranging from home automation, to sensor networks, building management systems and smart vehicles. This one-day workshop will concentrate on Python applications and technologies that exploit this global interconnectivity of people, devices, appliances, vehicles, sensors, embedded controllers, and computation.</p>
-->
<h2>First Time Speakers</h2>
<p>
We welcome first-time speakers; we are a community conference and we are eager to hear about your experience. If you have friends or colleagues who have something valuable to contribute, twist their arms to tell us about it! Please also forward this Call for Proposals to anyone that you feel may be interested.
</p>

<h2>Speaker Benefits</h2>
<p>
Speakers are eligible for discounted conference registration (early bird prices) that will be waived on request. If you, or your organisation, can afford to register at full price, such payments will go directly towards our financial assistance pool to help people who could not otherwise afford to attend the conference.
</p><p>
You will not be automatically registered as an attendee for the conference; you will need to register yourself and failure to do so may result in loss of your talk slot(s).</p>

<h2>Financial Assistance</h2>
<p>
PyCon Australia offers a generous <a href="/about/financial_assistance">financial assistance programme</a>, so that some attendees and speakers have some -- or in rare cases, all -- of their expenses such as flight, hotel and admission provided to them from the conference budget.
</p>
<p>
PyCon Australia strongly encourages people to apply for financial assistance -- even if we canâ€™t cover all of your expenses, we will give you free or discounted admission based on need. The application process is simple, and straightforward. Itâ€™s also very liberal -- the only caveat is that <b>accepted speakers are given priority</b> so that we donâ€™t lose a good talk because of financial need. We also donâ€™t ban anyone from applying.
</p>

<h2>Suggested Topics</h2>
<p>
Suitable topics for PyCon AU presentations include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Core Python, including Python 3 topics
</li><li>Other implementations: PyPy, IronPython, Jython.
</li><li>Web programming (Django, Pyramid, Flask, etc)

</ul>

<h2>Talk Format</h2>
<p>
The preferred length for talks is 30 minutes. We also accept extended proposals for tutorials and workshops of 90 minutes or three hours.
</p><p>
Session lengths include time for audience questions. You should budget at least five minutes for questions; for example, a 30-minute talk could comprise 25 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of questions.</p>

<h2>Presentation Recording</h2>
<p>Every session at PyCon Australia will have professionally-produced video recordings for release to our YouTube channel.
</p><p>
If you do not wish to have your talk recorded then please note this in your submission. Doing so will not influence the selection process in any way. You have the option to change your mind at any time.</p>
